<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/23547025">It's Mutual</a> by Janie_17  |  T  | 2841</b><br>“I’m in love with Harry,” Louis said firmly, hands on his hips.<br>“Great. Why are you telling me, exactly?” Niall barely lifted his head from the cereal bowl in front of him. Louis felt his own features twist in frustration.<br>“Because! You asked me for a good reason why he can’t come to your party.”<br>“Hmm,” Hummed Niall in response. “I think that’s more of a reason he should come, don’t you?” Grinning he pushed back the chair and walked his bowl over to the sink. “Just chill out about it and maybe it’ll even work in your favor. Besides, it’s our party.”</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/27111814">Every Time We Touch</a> by wabadabadaba  |  G  | 5806</b><br>Louis laughed when he heard the term professional cuddler for the first time. His doctor let Louis laugh and then explained the purpose behind the profession and how it could help Louis. It took a few weeks but Louis finally scheduled an appointment, now all he had to do was leave his car and walk into the house.<br>or the one where Louis is suffering from touch deprivation so he goes to see Harry who is a professional cuddler.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/23882935">I can’t do this alone (sometimes I just need a light)</a> by Only_angel_28  |  nr  | 7858</b><br>“Harry,” he says after another contemplative moment, “can I hug you?”<br>It’s been...well, Harry doesn’t actually know how long it’s been. Less than an hour, probably, but already Louis says his name like it’s safe in his mouth, and now he’s opening his arms like Harry could be safe there too.<br>“Please,” Harry nearly sobs, and sinks into him the way butter melts on toast. It’s an apt metaphor, really, because what Louis is giving him is as essential and sustaining as a loaf of bread to a starving man. His basic need for physical affection is as vital as his need for sustenance, for sleep, and he can’t believe he’s allowed himself to ignore it for so long.<br>Or: Harry is having a rough time. Louis is the kind stranger who makes him smile again.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/26184598">Loving You's the Antidote</a> by lululawrence  |  nr  | 11263</b><br>Nick and Harry had never been an obvious match. When eighteen-year-old Harry, newly presented as an omega, came home freshly bonded to Nick, a man nine years his elder and a beta no less, Anne had been more than skeptical and Eileen had shared some harsh words of her own. That didn’t deter them, though, and their families soon realised there really was something special about the bondmates that allowed them to work together almost seamlessly.<br>It was only a few months later that Harry started getting sick.<br>Or the one where Harry and Nick have been able to keep Harry's disorder at bay over the course of their relationship, but when they move to London and away from their support system, they find themselves in desperate need of help.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/24431569">Just a touch of your love</a> by thegirlontheblackhoodie  |  E  | 12168</b><br>“What if something happened to you? What would I say to Niall?”<br>“Nothing, he would have to wait to see my corpse on the news like everyone else.” Deadpanned Harry. Louis’ gasp was all the answer he got. Ok, so that might have been a bit too much. With a calmer voice, he said, “It’s really fine. I’ve walked to the tube countless times, I can handle myself. Just go home and tell Niall to stop mothering me.”<br>Louis was finally walking by his side and gave him a sideways glance before talking. “He doesn’t know, does he? Of your, uh, condition.” Harry tensed and his breath became erratic, but he didn’t say a word. Louis continued. “His nose probably hasn’t picked it up, and you’re lucky Liam’s also a beta, but it took me a minute to confirm it. Your scent is gettin’ so…” He seemed to struggle to find a word. He didn’t finish the sentence, but the emotion in his voice made Harry’s tummy churn.<br>--<br>Or, Harry is a touch starved omega trying to get through it on his own. Louis happens to be the only alpha around to realize it and offers to help.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/17250989">Etched in Salt (is a cathedral of the world)</a> by HelloAmHere  |  E  | 24417</b><br>Louis asks for very few things in life, and they are: to solve cases, to keep bad people from doing their bad things, to get good coffee, to go home to a spacious apartment with nobody else in it, and to manage his stupid telempathy powers with minimal interference. And now he's stuck in a tiny cabin in a snowstorm in the middle of god-awful-nowhere with Harry Styles. Because of course he is.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/12633921">Saving Symphony Hall</a> by HelloAmHere  |  E  | 124766</b><br>“I think I have an idea,” Louis said. Slowly, and reluctantly, but with a growing sense of the inevitable. “God damnit, I think I have a really good idea.”<br>“Oh christ, that's the problem-solving face,” Babs said. “Last time we saw that face, he sold a company.”<br>“Wait, what?” Zayn asked.<br>“Right place, right time,” Louis said. “Also, fuck my life,”<br>“What?” Zayn repeated. Niall patted his hand.<br>“I usually just roll with whatever Louis is about to do,” he said. “It’s better for us all.”<br>“That’s the attitude,” said Louis, “I’ll tell you tomorrow. Tonight, I need to do some research. Zayn, give me your number. I’m gonna save our symphony.”</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/3331958">Shake Me Down</a> by AGreatPerhaps12  |  nr  | 208589</b><br>Harry's new to college, fresh out of Catholic school and conversion therapy camp, and Louis runs the campus LGBTQIA organization.</p><p>
