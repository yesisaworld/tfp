It was that guy! Something Tomlinson, and if Harry wasn’t mistaken, he’d just been nominated for an Oscar.

He doesn't know that snails can sleep for three entire years, nor that an octopus' heart rate is tripled due to its inheritance of three cardiac organs. He doesn't know, because he's yet to dive into the enigmatic, limitless mind of Harry Edward Styles.<br>And when he finally knows, he doesn't ever want to go back.<br>Or: An enemies-to-lovers fic where Harry and Louis are neighbours who are forced to get along due to the inconvenience (or convenience) of a broken lift.</p><p>
