<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/26351395">The Section</a> by bananaheathen  |  M  | 11144</b><br>In which Louis is a TA for an Intro to Cinema course, and Harry is an undergrad with a bit of a crush.<br>Or, the one with "Name: Harry Styles, Date: me please"<br><i>As usual, it’s the Irish one he hears first.</i><br><i>“Keep up, Styles. It’s YOUR boyfriend we’re off to see.”</i><br><i>“He’ll have heard that, Niall, you arse. Thank you so much.”</i><br><i>Louis just has time to text Zayn: fuck.</i></p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/8945812">Baby, Teach Me How To</a> by FallingLikeThis  |  E  | 13316</b><br><i>At 10 am, the door to the studio classroom shuts with a bang that makes Harry jolt in his seat at the sound of it. He turns to see an absolutely gorgeous man standing there, hand still on the doorknob. His hair falls in a windswept swoop over his brow and he’s got a sexy scruff on his cheeks that Harry immediately can’t help imagining between his thighs. The man’s eyes shine with mirth, lips quirked into a wicked grin at having gotten a reaction from nearly everyone in the room. Harry watches him with unfettered curiosity, idly thinking he’d be a beautiful subject for a portrait as the man’s hand falls from the door.</i><br><i>“Hello, class,” he says, clapping his hands in front of him and Harry’s eyes have a hard time staying in his head.</i><br><i><b>This</b> is Professor Tomlinson?</i><br>Or</i><br>Louis is Harry's art professor and they both know it's forbidden to fall in love. Somehow, they manage to anyway.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/13006809">Please Be Naked</a> by Only_angel_28  |  E  | 17445</b><br><i>Louis starts squirming, desperately needing something to do with his hands. Needing to do anything, really, to distract him from the perfect male specimen standing naked in front of him. In the end, the only thing he can do is strip out of his own jeans and briefs, which he does with trembling, clumsy fingers, his heart beating out a violent, chaotic rhythm in his chest the entire time.</i><br><i>He hears Harry’s sharp intake of breath, and slowly raises his eyes from where he was staring at his own bare feet to meet his gaze.</i><br><i>“So,” Harry says bashfully, his voice gone even deeper somehow. “We’re naked.”</i><br><i>“Yup,” Louis squeaks.</i><br><i>“You okay?”</i><br>No!<br><i>“Yup,” Louis repeats, sounding just as unstable as he did the first time.</i><br><i>This is the last favor Louis Tomlinson is ever doing for Zayn Malik. (Because, after today, he’ll be dead, but that’s neither here nor there.)</i><br>*Or the one where Louis agrees to help out Zayn with one of his art projects and ends up getting much more than he bargained for.</p><p>
