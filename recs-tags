DECEMBER -> Santa 1, Santa 2
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/52074475">Santa Baby (one little thing I really need)</a> by we_are_the_same  |  T  | 3082</b><br>When Louis himself had first heard those words - all the nurses at the A&E have a secret line to Santa’s sleigh on Christmas Eve-, not nearly long enough ago to be considered a child himself, but long enough that he hadn't really felt like an adult all the time, he’d laughed them off. Thought they were sweet, of course, but just a line, something said to appease the kids who ended up having to stay overnight. Something to explain the presents that parents brought to the hospital on Christmas morning, or that were waiting for them at home, if they were lucky not to have to stay any longer.<br>Something that would allow a little bit of Christmas spirit in the sometimes sterile rooms of the hospital.<br>But that was before he’d met him.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/35411668">A Kiss for Christmas</a> by LadyAJ_13  |  T  | 3272</b><br>Louis meets Father Christmas, then twenty one years later, he meets his son.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/52464058">Step Into Christmas</a> by babyhoneyhslt  |  G  | 4003</b><br>Louis just wants to celebrate his birthday in peace, without all the Christmas antics.<br>Instead he wakes up in a strange bed, a confused stranger next to him and a self proclaimed elf calling him Santa.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/36073447">until springtime, we sleep (i'll wait for you)</a> by istgeve  |  nr  | 5081</b><br>“You’re on the naughty list.”<br>“I— what?”<br>“You’re on the na—“<br>“Yeah, I got that part. But what does it have anything to do w—“<br>“You’re on the naughty list.”<br>“Harry.”<br>“Yeah?”<br>“What the fuck?”<br>Or a Christmas AU where Louis is on the naughty list and is kidnapped by a very adorable Elf to serve his punishment.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/43851073">Ho Ho Hopefully</a> by muldxr  |  T  | 5144</b><br><i>Attached to the gift, just under the bow, was a paper tag, and Harry wished desperately that he could write his own name there. ‘To Louis, from Harry.’ What a dream that would be</i><br><i>He’d grown fond of Louis over the time that he’d been watching him, wishing that he could be part of Louis’ life, of his world, regardless of the fact that the only thing Harry had ever known was working for Father Christmas—or Nicholas, as he’d preferred to be called.</i><brThe one where Harry is an elf in Santa’s workshop, and Louis is one of the humans he’s been assigned to.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/36884185">Santa Claus Is Coming... To volunteer</a> by nekenma28  |  T  | 5405</b><br>Harry's little niece Charlie is going to spend Christmas for the first time without her mother by her side, so he decides to tell her a nice Christmas bedtime story. He just didn't understand how a made-up story could come true and Harry could become a volunteer Santa Claus responsible for delivering billions of gifts in one night having to put up with the provocative Louis elf.<br>But it's like the saying goes... Have Christmas spirit to give ho-ho-ho last!</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/21684808">Under the Pink Willow Tree</a> by brightlyharry  |  nr  | 7631</b><br>It's Christmas Eve and also Louis' eighteen birthday. It's the biggest day of Louis' life. He's been keeping up with his elfin studies for years all in preparation for this. He finally gets to join Santa on the sleigh.<br>Nothing Harry says can ruin this day for him, no matter how hard he tries.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/series/940605">Satan/Santa [Series]</a> by taggiecb  |  E  | 15853</b><br>Louis keeps stealing some of Harry’s mail, which would be annoying for anyone, but it’s especially troubling when you consider that Harry is Santa Claus. Harry will have to go through hell to get Louis to stop. Literally.<br>Or the one with Santa Harry and Satan Louis and a series of misspelled letters to Santa.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/17061794">Reindeer Games</a> by Throwthemflowers  |  E  | 19639</b><br>Louis is a disgruntled elf and Harry is one of Santa’s reindeer. Featuring classic miscommunication, heaps of unrequited pining, gratuitous smut (with a bit of, shall we say, horseplay), a pinch of NYC holiday magic, and a sickening amount of Christmas Spirit.</p><p>

<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/1074187">Ages Twelve and Below</a> by larryscape  |  G  | 1697</b><br>Louis works as an elf at the local mall, and Harry somehow thinks he can pass for being nine years old.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/43411843">The Elf who Saved Christmas</a> by LadyAJ_13  |  G  | 2628</b><br>Ernie and Doris are tired, grouchy, and no one told Louis you had to <i>book an appointment</i> to see Santa.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/1105839">Maybe It's Not So Bad After All</a>  |  nr  | 2815</b><br>Harry has to take Lux on a babysitting trip to Santa's Village. He goes there unhappy and comes back with an angel. Cue Niall as Santa's Helper</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/21649915">Santa's Lap</a> by larryatendoftheday  |  T  | 4227</b><br>Louis is a grown man, and he will absolutely not go see Santa with his siblings. And even if he gives in, he definitely won’t enjoy it. Right?<br>A Christmas story about unexpected gifts, featuring Harry as a mall Santa and Louis as a great big brother.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/43363278">santa, won't you bring me the one i really need?</a> by alwaysxlarrie  |  T  | 5539</b><br>This Christmas, Louis is going to ask for new friends, because his are the worst. That's the only possible explanation for how he's been dragged into dressing up as Santa and taking photos with strange small children at the mall for hours on end. I mean, Christmas is a season of being cheerful and all, but this is ridiculous!<br>...although the handsome guy who his friend somehow managed to persuade to play the elf is at least a small perk of the job.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/43710997">If you ever feel alone (Don't)</a> by beardyboyzx  |  G  | 9839</b><br>Louis is too busy worrying about helping his mum and paying the bills to let himself enjoy his teenage years and hang out with his friends. Enter Harry, who will help him reconcile with his friend and understand the difference between feeling lonely and being alone.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/30871493">A Larry Christmas</a> by Itstilliswhatitis  |  M  | 10182</b><br>Louis started a job as an Elf at a shopping mall in December. He was sad to be away from his family but he really needed the money. He has hoped that he would get to be Santa but some other dude was already dressed up as Santa when he came to work on his first day and introduced himself as Harry. At least he didn't have to be Rudolph's ass like that poor guy Zayn, stuck behind someone named Liam all day. A guy named Niall was also an Elf and then there was Anna, or Mrs. Clause as she often pointed out, especially after Harry removed his fake beard at lunchtime and they could see how good-looking he was.<br>Louis noticed too and all of a sudden his gloomy Christmas became exciting and wonderful and just a magical time to fall in love.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/2790761">let this one gift last forever</a> by princesshalo  |  M  | 10599</b><br>harry plays santa at the mall every year, and one day he meets a quirky little girl who instantly captures his heart. it doesn't take long for her father to do the same.</p><p>

Broke and desperate to see his family back home in England, he takes the only job left at the mall as one of Santa’s helpers.<br>Harry is an unconventional mall Santa, the youngest one they’ve had in years, but with as much holiday spirit as any other seasoned Saint Nick. He’s determined to un-Grinch the new guy in Santa’s Village if it takes until Christmas, then he finds out the devastating reason Louis has lost his Christmas cheer. Will Harry be just the thing Louis needs to help him get his sparkle back?<i><br>Featuring Liam as the manager at Santa's Village, Niall as an easy-going Irish elf and Harry's best friend, grumpy Grinch Louis and his best friend Zayn and one matchmaking Mrs. Claus.</i></p><p>

NOVEMBER -> Yachts
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/48001135">sea view</a>  |  E  | 3762</b><br>“What happened to pillow princessing your way through tour?”<br>“Woke up with a craving.”<br>____<br>Harry and Brad wake up on a yacht.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/933270">all caught up in your ebb and flow</a> by flimsy  |  E  | 5232</b><br>Liam and Louis find something to do that day on the yacht.<br><i>“Don’t be a knob,” he says and nudges his nose against Liam’s arm again, faux-snapping for him until Liam catches his jaw in his hand to stop him.</i><br><i>“No biting.” He grins and presses his thumb squarely over Louis’ lips and Louis scrunches up his nose, half-amused, half-annoyed because he can’t move at all with Liam’s arm around his shoulder and his hand holding him tightly, locking him in. He wiggles his tongue out until his taste buds bloom up with the salt from the sea that’s still stuck to Liam’s skin, and cocks a brow at Liam, grinning against his thumb when Liam’s eyes widen a little, mouth forming a perfect little ‘O’. Liam releases his chin, brows furrowing, and Louis chases his hand with the flat of his tongue, laughing.</i></p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/851976">time trickles down, breathing for two</a>  |  E  | 5591</b><br>Inspired by the boys' sojourn on a yacht in Miami. Because I think we were all a little bit turned on by what happened there.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/6969406">The Tide Rises</a> by Peachyhaz  |  E  | 6124</b><br><i>“It’s our yacht and I can proudly say that I’ve never fucked somebody in the middle of the Mediterranean.” Harry announced proudly. Zayn frowned down at him. He didn’t believe that for a second, especially since Harry was dripping with money that anyone would do anything to get to.</i><br>or Harry is filthy rich and wants to fuck Zayn on their new yacht</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/42396729">Under the Milky Way</a> by jacaranda_bloom  |  E  | 11023</b><br>Louis had always been a prankster, but being on tour provided him with countless opportunities to hone his skills with silly jokes and games, harmless really, and all in good fun. That was until the night he accidentally ended up in the wrong hotel room and dumped a bucket of iced water over a complete stranger.<br>Or the one where Louis is a rock star on tour, Harry is a free lance photographer, and drinking red wine under the stars might just be worth the hangover.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/50346874">Starlight</a> by cinnamoncurls  |  M  | 11630</b><br>“This is a disaster,” came Louis’ voice from across the room. Harry squeezed his eyes shut. He thought back to last night, when Gemma and him had had the bright idea to binge watch three whole seasons of Grey’s Anatomy.<br><i>Everything that could have gone wrong, did go wrong. Surgeons have a name for it. We call it a perfect storm.</i><br>It was his nineteenth birthday, and it was a perfect storm.<br>⭑ ⭑ ⭑<br>Sometimes all you need to do to get over a bad day is sneak into a yacht club party and pretend to be a duke and a prince with your platonic childhood best friend.<br>And snog the shit out of him. That too.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/5142263">too deep for this ship</a> by lsforever  |  E  | 19314</b><br>Harry is new in town. He's filthy rich, lives on the yacht his dad gave him, wears stupid Chelsea boots on the dirty, bird-shit covered dock, and while Louis tries to distance himself mentally from people like Harry, it's hard to when he has a smile like that. He's everything Louis never expected him to be and more, and it isn't long before Louis caves and gives himself to the gorgeous, bubbly lad.<br>~<br>Also known as the fic where Louis' profession is not common (previously unheard of by the author), Harry is a lovely contradiction like always, Niall is easily amused and constantly lazy, Liam is a secret-keeping little shit, and Zayn is a complete secret — at first. It all makes sense, eventually.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/16114115">Lost and Found</a> by shiftylinguini, Writcraft  |  E  | 31329</b><br>In a year when things are coming to an end for Nick, an unexpected chapter begins at the start of a long, hot summer.<br>An accidental romance in Malta. Featuring Annie on the decks, Nick and Louis below deck, a handful of bad nautical puns and weather that's far too hot for trackies.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/7617961">Ekman Spirals</a>  |  M  | 50403</b><br>The luxury yacht AU where Zayn's the steward who sees everything, Harry's the guest with mysterious bruises and a sad secret, there's much lustful pining, and Louis probably going to land everyone in jail.<br><i>Ekman Spirals: An Ekman Spiral is a theory to explain a type of sub-surface ocean current, where the direction of the current at the surface of the ocean moves in a different direction of the current deep underwater.</i></p><p>
