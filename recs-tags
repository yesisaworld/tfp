<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/32537197">Nora, Too</a> by JoMouse  |  G  | 3109</b><br>Zayn is having a terrible time in maths. Liam offers to tutor him. It doesn't go quite as planned.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/35398753">For the First Time (I Had Something to Lose)</a> by SullenFairy  |  T  | 7264</b><br>Louis is about to fail Biology. He usually wouldn't care -but- this is Senior year, and he has to get out of this small town. His teacher recruits Harry to tutor him. He didn't expect it would lead to an awakening.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/1220350">Sun-kissed Hurricane, Perfect Storm</a> by iwillpaintasongforlou  |  T  | 7692</b><br>Harry is the quiet kid in the back of his statistics class who writes a lot and dreams about Louis’ cheekbones . Louis needs a statistics tutor ASAP before he flunks and the quiet kid in the back of the class seems like a good choice. Harry wants to help Louis however he can and Louis wants to see how much he can make Harry blush.</p><p>

When Harry's grades begin to slip, fellow student Louis Tomlinson offers to help. As Louis begins to become a integral part of Harry's life, Harry has to decide whether to let Louis go or let him in on his secret.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/50145256">you know it ain't fiction, just a natural fact</a> by anditsonlyforthebrave  |  nr  | 13312</b><br>“Look, Lou” Harry whispers, “I can’t do it, and as much as I like having dinner with you, and hanging out, I think we should just do it without the tutoring part because I am not smart enough for school.”<br>“That’s bullshit,” Louis answers quickly, “what do you like?” he asks, “I mean, other than football and asking me stuff about my family. There must be something else you’re good at.”<br>“I play football and fuck, Louis. That’s it.”<br>Louis definitely doesn’t flinch at that. He does not.<br>---<br>Harry is the golden boy of the college football's team, Louis is their professors' golden student and they definitely don't have anything in common. Falling in love would be dumb.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/14756183">Cool Cats</a> by FallingLikeThis  |  T  | 16171</b><br>There’s a gorgeous boy sitting there, staring at him. His hair is longish, tucked back by a cloth headband, his eyes are a brilliant blue that make Marcel question if he’s ever actually seen real blue before or just cheap imitations of it. And his lips, thin and pink, are just slightly open, almost as though they’re inviting Marcel’s kiss.<br>“Oh,” the boy breathes in surprise and the tone is enough to wake Marcel from his momentary stupor. He realizes that the boy is staring at his ears and suddenly kisses are the furthest thing from Marcel’s mind.<br>Marcel exhales harshly and pulls out his chair, sinking into it and crossing his arms over his chest. He lifts his chin defiantly. “Alright, let’s have it.”<br>“Have… what?” The boy asks wide-eyed and, fuck, even his voice is beautiful. It’s got this delightful rasp to it that makes Marcel wanna purr.<br>“Whatever jokes or insults you’re gonna say. Let’s just get them over with now and out of the way,” Marcel says.<br>The blue-eyed cutie just sits there, staring.<br>Or<br>Sometimes, Marcel <i>can</i> have nice things.</p><p>

I’d probably be able to give you a better answer if I knew what you were talking about, though.”<br>“Harry, it’s okay. This is a safe space.”<br>“No, it’s not. You throw cheese puffs at me any time I walk around naked.”<br>“Okay.” Niall tilted his head in acknowledgement, then corrected himself. “It’s a safe space for things I deem acceptable.”<br>“Of course.” Harry rolled his eyes. “So, what’s the thing?”<br>“Your service,” Niall flailed his hands in the air for a few seconds, “thing.”<br>“My <i>service,</i>” Harry paused to mimic Niall’s hand movements, “<i>thing?</i>”<br>“Yes.”</p><p>

But he is also introduced to the king, the most intriguing man he's ever met.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/5799241">Soft Hands, Fast Feet, Can't Lose</a> by dolce_piccante  |  M  | 112853</b><br>American Uni AU. Harry Styles is a frat boy football star from the wealthy Styles Family athletic dynasty. A celebrity among football fans, he knows how to play, he knows how to party, and he knows how to fuck (all of which is well known among his legion of admirers).<br>Louis Tomlinson is a student and an athlete, but his similarities to Harry end there. Intelligent, focused, independent, and completely uninterested in Harry’s charms, Louis is an anomaly in a world ruled by football.<br>A bet about the pair, who might be more similar than they originally thought, brings them together. Shakespeare, ballet, Disney, football, library chats, running, accidental spooning, Daredevil and Domino’s Pizza all blend into one big friendship Frappucino, but who will win in the end?</p><p>

DECEMBER -> Santa 1, Santa 2
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/52074475">Santa Baby (one little thing I really need)</a> by we_are_the_same  |  T  | 3082</b><br>When Louis himself had first heard those words - all the nurses at the A&E have a secret line to Santa’s sleigh on Christmas Eve-, not nearly long enough ago to be considered a child himself, but long enough that he hadn't really felt like an adult all the time, he’d laughed them off. Thought they were sweet, of course, but just a line, something said to appease the kids who ended up having to stay overnight. Something to explain the presents that parents brought to the hospital on Christmas morning, or that were waiting for them at home, if they were lucky not to have to stay any longer.<br>Something that would allow a little bit of Christmas spirit in the sometimes sterile rooms of the hospital.<br>But that was before he’d met him.</p><p>

But what does it have anything to do w—“<br>“You’re on the naughty list.”<br>“Harry.”<br>“Yeah?”<br>“What the fuck?”<br>Or a Christmas AU where Louis is on the naughty list and is kidnapped by a very adorable Elf to serve his punishment.</p><p>

He just didn't understand how a made-up story could come true and Harry could become a volunteer Santa Claus responsible for delivering billions of gifts in one night having to put up with the provocative Louis elf.<br>But it's like the saying goes... Have Christmas spirit to give ho-ho-ho last!</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/21684808">Under the Pink Willow Tree</a> by brightlyharry  |  nr  | 7631</b><br>It's Christmas Eve and also Louis' eighteen birthday. It's the biggest day of Louis' life. He's been keeping up with his elfin studies for years all in preparation for this. He finally gets to join Santa on the sleigh.<br>Nothing Harry says can ruin this day for him, no matter how hard he tries.</p><p>

Harry will have to go through hell to get Louis to stop. Literally.<br>Or the one with Santa Harry and Satan Louis and a series of misspelled letters to Santa.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/17061794">Reindeer Games</a> by Throwthemflowers  |  E  | 19639</b><br>Louis is a disgruntled elf and Harry is one of Santa’s reindeer. Featuring classic miscommunication, heaps of unrequited pining, gratuitous smut (with a bit of, shall we say, horseplay), a pinch of NYC holiday magic, and a sickening amount of Christmas Spirit.</p><p>

<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/43363278">santa, won't you bring me the one i really need?</a> by alwaysxlarrie  |  T  | 5539</b><br>This Christmas, Louis is going to ask for new friends, because his are the worst. That's the only possible explanation for how he's been dragged into dressing up as Santa and taking photos with strange small children at the mall for hours on end. I mean, Christmas is a season of being cheerful and all, but this is ridiculous!<br>...although the handsome guy who his friend somehow managed to persuade to play the elf is at least a small perk of the job.</p><p>

He was sad to be away from his family but he really needed the money. He has hoped that he would get to be Santa but some other dude was already dressed up as Santa when he came to work on his first day and introduced himself as Harry. At least he didn't have to be Rudolph's ass like that poor guy Zayn, stuck behind someone named Liam all day. A guy named Niall was also an Elf and then there was Anna, or Mrs. Clause as she often pointed out, especially after Harry removed his fake beard at lunchtime and they could see how good-looking he was.<br>Louis noticed too and all of a sudden his gloomy Christmas became exciting and wonderful and just a magical time to fall in love.</p><p>
