<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/17611064">Sigh Softly</a> by aalexandravictoriaa  |  G  | 837</b><br>It was an unconventional nest, to say the least. Quite inconvenient too, not that Louis would ever dare admit that. The fact that his omega was nesting could only mean that he was pregnant and Louis’ chest rumbled at the mere thought. Harry stirred from his perch, blinking his eyes open at the sound of his growling alpha. Louis shushed him immediately and tucked him back into the safety of his nest. Louis just so happened to make up the majority of said nest.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/17145764">Do Not Falter (There's a Star Ahead)</a> by LadyLondonderry  |  nr  | 2853</b><br>It's Christmas Eve, and every single one of Louis' family members are crowded inside his little flat. Really, what more could he ask for on his birthday?<br>The present he never knew he wanted - in the form of an omega from his past - might just make this his most memorable Christmas.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/18455396">Send Me Your Pillow (The One That You Dream On)</a> by flowercrownfemme  |  G  | 3187</b><br>Harry is embarrassed to realize he's nesting but can't stop stealing Louis' things for his nest.<br>Short fluffy o/o gaybo drabble with lots of cuddles and softness and sock stealing <3</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/24332179">Tastes like Strawberries</a> by SadaVeniren  |  E  | 4960</b><br><i>I’m stressed. I’m nesting and demand cuddles. Come over</i><br>Harry frowned and double checked who the text was from. Yup, it still said Louis - Grad, which meant it was from Louis from his grad school.<br>aka Louis texts Harry by mistake. It works out</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/24456049">If you let me be your man</a> by lightswoodmagic  |  E  | 5129</b><br>“Do you need help?” the man asked again, and Zayn brightened. He did need help with his heat, and the fact the man had asked just proved he was supposed to be Zayn’s alpha. Perfect.<br>“Yes, need to go home,” Zayn sighed, pleased when the man pulled him closer, away from a few alphas watching him with interest. “Need my nest.”<br>The man pulled back, brow furrowed, but Zayn could see his dilated pupils and the harsh set of his jaw. “Your nest? Okay love, let’s go. What’s your name?”<br>“Zayn.” He smushed himself against the man’s side as he led Zayn outside with a hand at the small of his back. “You smell good.”<br>There was a low chuckle that Zayn felt in his toes as they wandered towards his room. “Thank you, so do you."<br>Or, Zayn can't help but trail after someone's scent when he starts his heat in the middle of their history exam. The man offers to help Zayn get home safely when he literally runs into him, but Zayn mistakenly thinks it's an offer to help with his heat.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/25224121">Waiting</a> by allwaswell16  |  E  | 8023</b><br>Louis Tomlinson was Harry’s omega, of this Harry had always been sure. Unfortunately for Harry, Louis seemed to think they were just best friends. The six weeks that Harry has to live with Louis were going to be rough.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/24294892">We Both Got Nothing to Hide</a> by lovelarry10  |  E  | 43811</b><br><i>“Talk to me, Lou.”</i><br><i>“I can’t,” Louis mumbled, knowing he genuinely couldn’t say it. He couldn’t admit to what he was doing. “Don’t ask me to say it, because I can’t.”</i><br><i>“Then… I’ll try and guess. You’ve… got some stuff of Harry’s. Something of his to make it smell like him?”</i><br><i>Louis just nodded, eyes fixated on the floor. This was humiliating, but he knew Zayn wouldn’t stop until he found out what was going on.</i><br><i>“Okay. Like… a blanket, or a comforter or something?”</i><br><i>“Kind of…”</i><br>//<br>Omega Louis has a secret nest. Alpha Harry keeps losing his clothes.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/25171498">sleeping on our problems</a> by falsegoodnight  |  E  | 67369</b><br><i>I’m in love with you,</i> Louis thinks. He feels empty, weighed down by his sadness and the loss of Harry inside him just moments ago before his knot finally went down. <br>There’s moments where he’s sure Harry feels the same. Like now, when he’s gazing down at Louis with so much adoration and tenderness. It’s like they’re both on the cusp of something more, but neither of them ever say a word. <br>His confession is on the tip of his tongue ready to slide out like honey, and yet he remains silent. They both do, looking at each other and recognizing the reluctance mirrored in each other’s eyes. It’s then that Louis realizes they’re both scared.<br>-<br>Or Louis sleeps with Harry and they have more than just catching feelings to worry about.</p><p>
