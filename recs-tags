<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/48001135">sea view</a>  |  E  | 3762</b><br>“What happened to pillow princessing your way through tour?”<br>“Woke up with a craving.”<br>____<br>Harry and Brad wake up on a yacht.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/933270">all caught up in your ebb and flow</a> by flimsy  |  E  | 5232</b><br>Liam and Louis find something to do that day on the yacht.<br><i>“Don’t be a knob,” he says and nudges his nose against Liam’s arm again, faux-snapping for him until Liam catches his jaw in his hand to stop him.</i><br><i>“No biting.” He grins and presses his thumb squarely over Louis’ lips and Louis scrunches up his nose, half-amused, half-annoyed because he can’t move at all with Liam’s arm around his shoulder and his hand holding him tightly, locking him in. He wiggles his tongue out until his taste buds bloom up with the salt from the sea that’s still stuck to Liam’s skin, and cocks a brow at Liam, grinning against his thumb when Liam’s eyes widen a little, mouth forming a perfect little ‘O’. Liam releases his chin, brows furrowing, and Louis chases his hand with the flat of his tongue, laughing.</i></p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/851976">time trickles down, breathing for two</a>  |  E  | 5591</b><br>Inspired by the boys' sojourn on a yacht in Miami. Because I think we were all a little bit turned on by what happened there.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/6969406">The Tide Rises</a> by Peachyhaz  |  E  | 6124</b><br><i>“It’s our yacht and I can proudly say that I’ve never fucked somebody in the middle of the Mediterranean.” Harry announced proudly. Zayn frowned down at him. He didn’t believe that for a second, especially since Harry was dripping with money that anyone would do anything to get to.</i><br>or Harry is filthy rich and wants to fuck Zayn on their new yacht</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/42396729">Under the Milky Way</a> by jacaranda_bloom  |  E  | 11023</b><br>Louis had always been a prankster, but being on tour provided him with countless opportunities to hone his skills with silly jokes and games, harmless really, and all in good fun. That was until the night he accidentally ended up in the wrong hotel room and dumped a bucket of iced water over a complete stranger.<br>Or the one where Louis is a rock star on tour, Harry is a free lance photographer, and drinking red wine under the stars might just be worth the hangover.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/50346874">Starlight</a> by cinnamoncurls  |  M  | 11630</b><br>“This is a disaster,” came Louis’ voice from across the room. Harry squeezed his eyes shut. He thought back to last night, when Gemma and him had had the bright idea to binge watch three whole seasons of Grey’s Anatomy.<br><i>Everything that could have gone wrong, did go wrong. Surgeons have a name for it. We call it a perfect storm.</i><br>It was his nineteenth birthday, and it was a perfect storm.<br>⭑ ⭑ ⭑<br>Sometimes all you need to do to get over a bad day is sneak into a yacht club party and pretend to be a duke and a prince with your platonic childhood best friend.<br>And snog the shit out of him. That too.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/5142263">too deep for this ship</a> by lsforever  |  E  | 19314</b><br>Harry is new in town. He's filthy rich, lives on the yacht his dad gave him, wears stupid Chelsea boots on the dirty, bird-shit covered dock, and while Louis tries to distance himself mentally from people like Harry, it's hard to when he has a smile like that. He's everything Louis never expected him to be and more, and it isn't long before Louis caves and gives himself to the gorgeous, bubbly lad.<br>~<br>Also known as the fic where Louis' profession is not common (previously unheard of by the author), Harry is a lovely contradiction like always, Niall is easily amused and constantly lazy, Liam is a secret-keeping little shit, and Zayn is a complete secret — at first. It all makes sense, eventually.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/16114115">Lost and Found</a> by shiftylinguini, Writcraft  |  E  | 31329</b><br>In a year when things are coming to an end for Nick, an unexpected chapter begins at the start of a long, hot summer.<br>An accidental romance in Malta. Featuring Annie on the decks, Nick and Louis below deck, a handful of bad nautical puns and weather that's far too hot for trackies.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/7617961">Ekman Spirals</a>  |  M  | 50403</b><br>The luxury yacht AU where Zayn's the steward who sees everything, Harry's the guest with mysterious bruises and a sad secret, there's much lustful pining, and Louis probably going to land everyone in jail.<br><i>Ekman Spirals: An Ekman Spiral is a theory to explain a type of sub-surface ocean current, where the direction of the current at the surface of the ocean moves in a different direction of the current deep underwater.</i></p><p>
