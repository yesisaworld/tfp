<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/12276567">(Every day I hope to see a moving truck pull in. Or an ambulance.)</a> by softly  |  G  | 1445</b><br>I am writing a book of love poetry for you. For example: “The only reason you could possibly need your music that loud is if you were planning to listen from my apartment. You downstairs motherfuckers.”</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/13509528">the right type (your knight in shining armor)</a> by radiantbeams  |  G  | 1548</b><br>The “I live next door and I heard screaming so I came over thinking someone was getting murdered and now we’re both trying to get the spider out of your apartment” AU<br>Including late night conversations and broke college students and Niall promises he does <i>not</i> have a savior complex, he <i>doesn't.</i></p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/15006242">i used to be a baker</a> by twistofpayne  |  G  | 2319</b><br>It's the third time this month that Harry's upstairs neighbor has set off the fire alarm in his flat, and Harry decides to take matters into his own hands. Turns out the new neighbor is a bit more mouth-watering than he expected.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/19406569">or are you giving it to someone else</a> by louistomlinsons  |  E  | 3337</b><br>“Dude, last night I couldn’t tell if he was being murdered or having the best sex of his life,” Louis said, taking a sip of his beer. He tried to say it as quietly as he could in the loud pub, worried about who may overhear him.<br>“Is this your neighbor?” Liam asked. He was newer to the group, and therefore, newer to the situation. He had only heard a handful of the stories about the strange things Louis heard his neighbor doing, as opposed to the book Louis could most definitely write about the man.<br>In the hallways, he seemed perfectly normal. He would smile at Louis and sometimes make polite conversation.<br>He didn’t seem like the type to be having loud, kinky sex every night at the craziest hours of the day.<br>But he was.<br>or, louis hears his neighbor having loud sex through the walls and it's not a problem until it is</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/21032087">One Man's Ceiling Is Another Man's Floor</a> by kingsofeverything  |  E  | 3713</b><br>Niall and Maggie come up with a way to get revenge on her annoying neighbors.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/4674296">these walls are thin, but my love for you is thick</a> by whatmakeslarrybeautiful  |  T  | 4003</b><br>Louis' flat has paper thin walls. Which means he can hear his new neighbor, Harry, singing. And moaning. When he does meet Harry, he is lovely and awkward and beautiful. Louis is completely endeared, and one day he comes upon Harry singing nursery rhymes to a child. Maybe thin walls and Louis' entire life has lead up to this. Needless to say, he joins them.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/5685463">in the next room</a> by misslou  |  M  | 4987</b><br>Louis is tired of his apartment neighbor having loud sex while he's trying to sleep. He knows that the only way to get back at him is to play his own game. Harry is sick of the nights spent with girls whose names he can't remember, but is even more sick of his neighbor desperately trying to get back at him. When a confrontation ensues, romance buds.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/25528693">Hate to Smoke (Without Me)</a> by louhazpride  |  M  | 12164</b><br><i>“For fuck’s sake,” he huffs, grabbing the pillow and pulling it on top of his head in an attempt to block out the banging coming from the other side of the wall.</i><br><i>It’s the third time this week that his neighbour has woken him up in the middle of the night with his little ‘rendezvous.’ Honestly, he's quite sick of it. There’s only so much sex he can bear to hear in one week and he has already hit his limit. If he wanted to listen to someone having sex, he’d turn to porn.</i><br><i> As if the noises weren’t enough, Harry immediately becomes aware of the faint aroma of weed filling his flat.</i><br><i> “I’m going to murder him.”</i><br>Sleep. Harry just wants one good night of sleep. However, his neighbour has a thing for headboard-banging-against-the-wall-sex every night. After a secret set-up and a bet, Harry may finally get the sleep he so much desires.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/26555224">the anticipation of knowing you</a> by Anonymous  |  T  | 13028</b><br><i>Hello Neighbor!</i><br><i>Just wanted to let you know that you were having sex so loud and scarily I called our building manager and security officer because I thought you were hurt.</i><br><i>P.S. I sent them away when I heard you yell ‘cock’. I’m sorry that I heard that, but I wanted you to know in case they stopped by to check on you or something.</i><br><i>Sorry!</i><br><i>Your neighbor Louis Tomlinson in apartment #306</i><br>After Louis overhears his next door neighbor having sex, he doesn’t really expect anything but awkward hallway encounters to come from it. Instead, he’s surprised to find himself in a whirlwind pen pal relationship with the sweet, albeit loud, baker next door.</p><p>
