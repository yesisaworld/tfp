<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/936765">Odd or Even</a> by rivers_bend  |  E  | 1111</b><br>I said: but what if I have too many feelings about Nick tugging the hair on the insides of Harry's thighs? what if that? on twitter, and disarm_d said she didn't believe there could be too many feelings about such a thing and I should tell her about it. So I did.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/2032260">Thighs</a> by Kittycat  |  E  | 1393</b><br>Louis has a slight obsession with wanting to mark Harry's thighs and he finally has a chance to do it.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/51036130">Tempting Thighs</a> by red_panda28  |  E  | 1620</b><br><i>He hadn’t been lying when he told this was the best thing he ever had the pleasure to unwrap, slowly pushing Harry’s trousers down his thighs, and all the way off his legs; Harry helping by lifting his hips and then he was lying there, all spread out for Louis to devour with his eyes.</i><br><i>“Look so gorgeous, love,” he whispered, sliding his hands from Harry’s knees up his thighs and brushing his thumbs over his lace-covered hip bones.</i><br>OR<br>Louis fucks Harry's thighs</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/5725447">Nice Legs, Daisy Dukes, Etc.</a> by mdashes  |  E  | 1952</b><br>Non-AU, vaguely present day, Louis fucks Harry's thighs. Zero percent plot, zero percent bants/chats/lols, one hundred percent irredeemable.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/3165113">'Cause Lately I've Been Craving More</a> by sweaterpawstyles  |  E  | 2664</b><br><i>"Fuck-" Harry cried out so loudly and desperately. "Daddy!"</i><br><i>"That's right," Louis placed both of his hands securely onto Harry's ankles in an attempt to steady him. "Everyone will know what your daddy did to you. Mon beau garçon."</i><br>Or<br>Louis likes to speak French between Harry's thighs</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/49733368">The Cats that Got the Cream</a> by yeah_alright  |  M  | 3032</b><br>When Louis accidentally releases the tiger trapped in Harry's thigh tattoo, Harry has to explain not just what the fuck is happening, but that it's not just a tiger. Luckily, Louis has a secret of his own that might help.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/3943495">first position, the mood is set</a> by hiswittlehands  |  M  | 3088</b><br><i>Louis bites down on his lip. "You...god, they look so good on you. Shows off your arse and your...your thighs, Haz." He runs his hand along the skin there then, relishing how soft and pliant it is even with all the muscle. "They shouldn't have even let you play. Should, should have sent you straight home for...fuck, indecency or breaking the dress code or summat."</i><br>Or, I literally have no idea what the fuck I just wrote but it involves dodgeball, short shorts, and thigh fucking.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/22972165">Strip That Down</a> by lovelarry10  |  E  | 7542</b><br>“You’re doing well,” came Louis’ voice, and Harry’s eyes flew open, craning his head to see Louis sat on the sofa across the room, legs crossed, hands resting in his lap as he sat there, an amused smile on his lips. “A bit of a wimp, but I guess it must hurt-”<br>“You guess? My legs are on fucking fire, Louis,” Harry retorted, his voice a little shaky still. The alcohol he’d been consuming all night was doing nothing to numb the pain, and the thought Louis thought he was a wimp wasn’t helping. “You have literally no idea how much this hurts.”<br>“No pain kink, then. I’ll bear that in mind,” Louis said smugly as Jesy walked back into the room, a fresh pot of wax in her hands. “Oh goody, here we go again.”<br>“Please don’t do my thighs, please-”<br>“Them’s the rules…” Jesy muttered as she started swiping wax over Harry’s left thigh.<br>*****<br>Offering to wax his legs as part of a bet wasn’t one of Harry's finer ideas, but if it has Louis ogling his thighs, who is he to complain?</p><p>
