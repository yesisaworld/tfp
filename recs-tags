<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/1146543">I can't help but protect you.</a> by sweetkisses  |  nr  | 1508</b><br>Harry will always protect Louis.<br>Or, Harry and Louis play hockey and Harry fights Louis' fights for him.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/56791210">Melting For You</a> by Rosann1986  |  nr  | 2534</b><br>Harry and Louis are hockey teammates and best friends...and soon to be something more. A seasonal one-shot.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/926819">Caught Me Thinking</a> by stylesforstiles  |  nr  | 5410</b><br>Harry didn't think he liked hockey...that was until he realized Louis played it</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/1171163">cold as ice</a> by evidentlouis  |  M  | 7385</b><br>They're hockey players and Zayn loves Liam a whole bunch.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/1033405">we should get jerseys</a>   |  M  | 12147</b><br><i>There’s a lot surrounding Harry, and Louis knows, in his heart of hearts, that there always will be. He just doesn’t know if he’ll manage to equate into the ‘always’ of it.</i><br>Harry is a hockey player, and Louis is his slightly melodramatic boyfriend.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/41464920">On Thin Ice</a> by Neondiamond  |  E  | 16439</b><br>As the goaltender for one of the best hockey teams in the world, Harry never expected participating in his second winter Olympics would be so eventful. His hidden long-term relationship with the captain of their biggest rival team may have something to do with it.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/50463043">i've got something to confess, i keep you in my pocket to use</a> by babylwt  |  E  | 16770</b><br>"You made Harry Styles practically swoon over you, admit you’re beautiful to basically the world, he asked for your number and you said no. Like, you have to be joking.” Bella tsks as she sits up straight, grabbing Louis’ computer off his lap and putting it off to the side. Louis moves to reach for it, sighing in defeat as he leans back against his pillows.<br>“You know how it goes with those sports guys. They’re just after having a good time before they have to go to the next city and play another game and find another person to swoon.” Louis explains. “It just wouldn’t have worked and I’m too busy right now.” Louis shrugs.<br>“Too busy to fuck Harry Styles?” Bella asks with a raised brow.<br>“Yes, even too busy to fuck Harry Styles.”<br>Or<br>Prompt 251: Harry is a hockey player and he's in the middle of a press conference when Louis, a journalist, asks him a question. Harry sees him ans says something like "oh my god, he's so beautiful" to his teammate and only realized his mic was on when the pretty boy blushes and the room breaks in a laugh</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/11035794">power play</a> by sweatpantstomlinson  |  E  | 34863</b><br>Louis and Liam play for rival professional hockey teams, but somewhere between the constant travel, grueling workouts and endless laps on the ice, they fell for each other. Only issue? No one knows they’re together...or even that they’re gay.<br>After the first playoff game - where Louis’ team is knocked out and Liam’s team is the frontrunner to win the Stanley Cup - things get complicated.<br>Featuring: bro-y bros having feelings, plenty of emotional hockey scenes (but only one fight), dumbass romantic dinners, did I mention feelings, other bros being bro-y with bros in a very bro way, lots of shower sex, but did I mention the feelings, Niall puking, a pinch of angst and a handful of floof and FEELINGS.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/1752020">The Underdogs</a> by blackwayfarers  |  E  | 49585</b><br>Zayn Malik hates everything about winter. He hates the snow, he hates scraping the ice from his car, he hates freezing every time he steps outside, he hates wearing hats and heavy jackets. In fact, the only thing he doesn't hate about it are his hockey player buddies and his childhood best friend, Liam Payne, the teenage star hockey player and captain of their small town team.<br>An AU about boys learning how to deal with a terrible Canadian winter.</p><p>
