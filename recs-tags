<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/49738018">Tongue Tied</a> by YesIsAWorld  |  G  | 1252</b><br>Louis’ new bestie placed a hand on his shoulder; he turned with a sway and looked into his blue eyes. ”What do you wish?”<br>The world spun for a moment, and Louis shrugged. It was easy. The only thing he wanted. “I wish that I could tell Harry that I love him, instead of getting all tongue tied and chickening out.”<br>The Irishman winked. “You never know, your wish may just come true.”<br>“From your lips to God’s ears, mate.” He gave the man a hug. “I gotta go before my Uber leaves me.”<br>He stumbled to the door, and that was the last thing he remembered from the night.</p><p>

<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/58688542">A Tight Space</a> by haztobegood  |  T  | 2313</b><br>Niall pushes the bedroom door open. A huge mass of brown fur bolts between his legs. Louis startles with a hand to his chest.<br>“What the fuck was that?”<br>“Oh, that’s the cat. I told you Liam found a stray a few days ago. That’s him.”<br>“Are you sure that’s a cat?”</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/49733368">The Cats that Got the Cream</a> by yeah_alright  |  M  | 3032</b><br>When Louis accidentally releases the tiger trapped in Harry's thigh tattoo, Harry has to explain not just what the fuck is happening, but that it's not just a tiger. Luckily, Louis has a secret of his own that might help.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/70668841">do you feel what I feel (does it feel right?)</a> by we_are_the_same  |  T  | 4285</b><br>His ears are ringing as he slowly shuffles through the hallway, head bowed and the hood of his sweatshirt all but pulled over his face. There's a quiet but insistent headache pulsing at his temples and he breathes in shakily before knocking just once on the nondescript hotel door that currently feels like it's potentially going to save his life.<br>He stumbles across the threshold the moment the door opens, and Zayn’s arms are there to catch him, wrapping around him in a hug that makes him feel as though he’s finally able to breathe.<br>And this. They didn’t used to do this. They didn’t hug. They weren’t the kind of friends that were comfortable like that. Hell, a few weeks ago they weren’t friends at all. And even right now, he’s not sure what they are.<br>He just knows that Zayn wraps his arms around him and the ringing stops. Oscar could cry.</p><p>

The words burst out of him.<br>“But,” and yes, he is actually wailing the tiniest bit, but he’s disappointed, so sue him. “If you’re a bottom, and I’m a bottom, then who’s going to top, Lou. <i>Who’s going to top?</i>”</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/20387392">Knight Changes</a> by graceling_in_a_suit  |  M  | 10507</b><br>Louis has a promise to keep and a curse to break for a man in a bog. Niall, Liam, and Zayn are along for the ride. The real friends are the dragons we slay along the way.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/41772651">Losing That Reactive Spark</a> by whoknows  |  E  | 11599</b><br>“You didn’t shock me,” the O says, yanking at Harry’s shirt. Harry’s eyebrows furrow, looking down at him. He could probably shake him off if he wanted to, wouldn’t even hurt him. Harry doesn’t. “What’s your name? How come you didn’t shock me?”<br>“Um,” Harry says. “What?”<br>The O sways closer, pushing himself up onto his toes as he peers at Harry’s face. Harry tries not to breathe in too deeply, too obviously. The last thing he needs is for someone to catch him obviously scenting an O that doesn’t belong with him in public. No matter how unhinged that particular O might be. That’s just asking for trouble.<br>“Is it broken?” the O asks, shaking at Harry’s shirt. Harry sways, more confused than ever. The bell on the door dings, and on autopilot Harry shifts them out of the way, allowing the person to pass. His umbrella dangles uselessly from his hand, not doing anything to keep them dry.<br>“Is what broken?” Harry asks.<br>“It’s not broken,” the O says to himself, fast. He shakes his head again, bringing both hands up to his face to push his wet hair back. “Just yesterday – ”<br>He stops, staring at Harry again. It’s a suspicious stare. Harry’s mildly offended by it.</p><p>
