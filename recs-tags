<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/51272824">Marionette</a> by Anonymous  |  E  | 2733</b><br>Harry is a vampire on the hunt.<br>He doesn’t know that he’s not the top of the food chain.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/46727740">Just a little taste</a> by lunarheslwt  |  G  | 3688</b><br>“Little dove,” Louis crooned, making Harry shiver a little, affected, “you’re shaking. Do you want to bite?”<br>Harry stilled. He knew what Louis was asking. He knew Louis probably could sense how in dire need of comfort he was. He knew Louis was offering. And yet-<br>“No,” he whispered, even as he felt the strong urge to let his lips trace the well-known path to the spot he usually bit into, “I could hurt you.”<br>“Harry, my darling, you haven’t hurt me once in the numerous times you’ve needed to bite. Today will be no different. You know it’ll do you good.”<br>Harry sucked his bottom lip between his teeth, torn. In the end, it was an offer he was too weak to resist.<br>“So…do you want to? Little taste?”<br>“Yeah,” Harry rasped out, “please.”<br>Or, Harry is a vampire that comes home one night, grappling with the darkness that comes with being one. Louis offers him unwavering love, acceptance and the one thing he needs but is reluctant to ask for; permission to bite for the sake of comfort and safety seeking.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/54291211">Nothing's Greater Than the Rush</a> by therogueskimo  |  E  | 8303</b><br>Good luck. That’s how whoever had turned him had signed off their little instruction manual, as though this was the most natural thing in the world. As though being a vampire - which Louis didn’t even know existed until he was one - was normal, something that happened every day.<br>To survive being turned into a vampire, Louis must feed on the person he loves most. There's just one little problem: that person is his best friend, Harry, and Harry has no idea.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/42720462">Liquid Gold</a> by wabadabadaba  |  E  | 9273</b><br>Harry’s original intention wasn’t to tease but he couldn’t stop himself. He leaned forward, dropping on his hands, and let his teeth graze Louis’ jaw. He delighted in Louis’ reaction- his breath hitched and was uneven, his body was pliant, and his eyes were already dilating. Harry moved his fangs from Louis’ jaw down to his neck, right over his jugular vein.<br>Harry’s eyes rolled back as he smelled Louis’ blood- there was the bitter copper smell that all blood had with notes of something sweet. He applied the tiniest amount of pressure, enough for Louis to stop breathing all together, and licked the vein. He kissed it and pulled away from Louis completely.<br>or, Louis has a biting kink and the only person he thinks can fulfill it is his vampire friend, Harry.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/20042137">it's me and my plus one at the afterlife</a> by mrsenjolras  |  T  | 9322</b><br>It all starts because Liam Payne makes a stupid decision.<br>Well, that’s not exactly true. Technically it starts when Louis turns 16 and becomes the Slayer, the chosen one to fight all evil forces in the world and to prevent the apocalypse, blah blah, major responsibility, saving the world, et cetera et cetera.<br>But this time? This time Liam did something really, really dumb.<br>[Or: Louis is the Slayer, Nick and Harry are vampires, and Liam and Niall make up the rest of the Scoobies.]</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/4000807">just a little rush, babe</a>  |  G  | 10296</b><br><i>“You know everything they say about Dracula? All that stuff I wrote in my paper?” Niall asks as he rips one of the glazed donuts in half. Harry hums. “It’s all bullshit. Real vampires do tomato juice cleanses and do yoga. Fuck.”</i><br>Harry's a vampire who's awful at parallel parking, being scary, and being alone. He meets Niall walking home alone one night.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/21245045">In This Room</a> by thisonegoes  |  E  | 17675</b><br>It’s his neck that first catches Zayn's eye and stops him in his tracks. A shirtless man with his back to him, his hands up in his hair, practically stumbling into the other humans dancing around him.<br>It's a lovely neck.<br>A Zarry Vampire AU. Happy Halloween.</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/50330518">Death Wish</a> by Speechless  |  E  | 22067</b><br>Louis hates vampires, he lives his life trying to kill as many as he can, night after night, year after year.<br>He hates them.<br>Then why the fuck is he kissing one?<br>Again.<br>“I mean it, Harry.” Louis says, into his mouth this time. “You need to get the fuck away from me.”</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/50758165">Scorpions et mandragores</a> by Stria  |  E  | 22934</b><br>Vampires were rich gents, well-versed in the unspoken rules of polite society, knowledgeable about an infinity of topics, ready to lend a hand in historiography debates. Vampires were charming, fashionable, mysterious. Vampires drank synth or donated blood, played nice with humans, didn’t bite anymore. Vampires were nice, non-threatening.<br>What a load of bullshit.<br>(Or, in a world where vamps have come out of the coffin, vampire Harry's tired to play nice with food, and gets obsessed with human Louis, fresh-faced and captivating.)</p><p>
