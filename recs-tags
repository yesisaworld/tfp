<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/13582503">maybe</a> by momentofclarity  |  G  | 2371</b><br><i>I cannot not see you again. I cannot.</i></p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/2699426">Old Dog, New Tricks</a> by becka  |  E  | 10269</b><br>Nick’s thirty-eight years old and just been dumped. Moving into his old flat in Primrose Hill feels like a further step backwards, but at least he has a new (old, flatulent) dog and long-suffering BFF Daisy Lowe for company, and the hot young barrister down the street is awfully friendly...</p><p>
<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/1024563">Forever and a Night</a> by sunsetmog  |  E  | 27892</b><br>Because the thing is, Nick has a rule, and he's normally <i>shit</i> at rules, but this one he's worked really, really hard at to keep. He doesn't have sex with people who aren't old enough to vote, because he's not a dirty old man, no matter how much it feels like it when he walks down the road holding Harry's hand. Because he's a good person, deep down inside. Because he's nine and a half years older than Harry, and he's trying to do a good thing. He's trying to do the best thing for Harry, who might think that he likes Nick now, but five years in the future he's going to look back and think, <i>god, what a perv</i> about Nick, and Nick desperately, desperately doesn't want that.<br>Except it's Harry's eighteenth birthday, and Nick's rule doesn't apply anymore, and all bets are off.</p><p>

<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/16034891">Tell Me It’s The Strongest Shape</a> by YesIsAWorld  |  E  | 73224</b><br>Nick and Elgar have it all.

<p><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/2148573">Have Faith In Me</a> by stylinsoncity  |  M  | 183417</b><br>As the son of Anne Styles, millionaire owner of one of the world's most luxurious fashion labels, Harry has spent his last seventeen years living in carefree extravagance.
